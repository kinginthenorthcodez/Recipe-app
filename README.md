## Recipe App

> The Recipe app keeps track of all your recipes and ingredients. It will allow you to save ingredients, keep track of what you have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what you have and what you are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking the app should allow you to make them public so anyone can access them.

## Built With

- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- devise - for authentication
- cancancan - for authorization
